# odin-recipes

This is a recipe website that I am developing while following The Odin Project curriculum. This project will demonstrate the html skills I have developed so far by following this course. By doing this project I am also putting into practice my knowledge of git and the command line. I will be updating this project as I further expand my knowledge of web development.

Update: I have completed the website as described in the assignment. All three recipes were copied from allrecipes.com are not my own. I initially made the mistake of forgetting to put the first two recipes in the recipes directory I had made when starting the project and this led to some confusion with my commits but I was able to solve the issue easily. My problem was forgetting to cd out of the recipes directory when adding the changes. Overall I enjoyed the project. It was a fun way to put my html skills to use.
P.S.  I think it would be cool to add a search function with a filter for allergies as that is something I would find helpful myself.
