# odin-recipes

This is a recipe website that I am developing while following The Odin Project curriculum. This project will demonstrate the html skills I have developed so far by following this course. By doing this project I am also putting into practice my knowledge of git and the command line. I will be updating this project as I further expand my knowledge of web development.
