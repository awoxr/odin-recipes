        <li>1 (10 oz) can diced tomatoes and green chiles</li>
        <li>3 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>2 tsp ground tumeric</li>
        <li>1 tsp chopped basil</li>
        <li>1 pinch garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt and black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch seasoned salt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cubed large red potatoes</li>
        <li>1 chopped green bell pepper</li>
        <li>1 medium chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 minced clove garlic</li>
        <li>1 15 oz can black beans</li>
        <li>6 flour tortillas</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh spinach</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped romaine lettuce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup salsa</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F</li>
        <li>Boil water and brown rice in saucepan. Stir in diced tomatoes with chile peppers. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, about 50 minutes.</li>
        <li>While rice is cooking, mix cumin, tumeric, basil, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and seasoned salt together in a large bowl. Add olive oil. Toss potatoes in the mixture until well coated. Lay potatoes in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until fork-tender, 15 to 30 minutes, depending on the size of the cubes, checking halfway through cooking time and flipping over as needed.</li>
        <li>While potatoes are cooking, heat a skillet over medium heat. Saute bell pepper and onion in the hot pan until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat black beans in a saucepan over medium-low heat until hot, 2 to 3 minutes. Keep warm.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat tortillas in a separate skillet over low heat until warm, 1 to 2 minutes, or according to package instructions.</li>
        <li>Lay out tortillas and fill as desired with cooked rice, beans, potatoes, pepper-onion mixture, spinach, romaine lettuce, and salsa as desired. Wrap up into burritos and serve.</li>
