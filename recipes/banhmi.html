    <h1>V*gan Banh Mi</h1>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Your favorite Vietnamese sandwich has gone vegan, served in a bowl. Classic ingredients are replaced with vegan alternatives and you get to eat it with a fork. Refrigerate any of the leftover vegan fish sauce for other recipes that call for fish sauce or oyster sauce.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup vegan worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup tamari soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>1 shiitake mushroom</li>
        <li>1 tbsp fermented black bean paste</li>
        <li>1 tbsp minced shallot</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 strip nori seaweed</li>
        <li>4 1/2 oz tempeh</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vegan mayo</li>
        <li>1 tsp siracha sauce</li>
        <li>1 6 inch French baguette, sliced into bite-sized cubes</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 jalapeno pepper, sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 oz pickled carrot</li>
        <li>2 cucumber slices</li>
        <li>3 tbsp chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Warm Worcestershire sauce, tamari, water, mushroom, black bean paste, shallot, garlic clove, and seaweed in a saucepan over medium heat. Remove from heat and let cool. Drain sauce and discard the solids.</li>
        <li>Place tempeh in a bowl and pour 1/3 cup of the sauce on top. Marinate for 20 minutes, turning tempeh over halfway.</li>
        <li>Remove 1 teaspoon of the tempeh marinade and whisk together with vegan mayo and sriracha in a separate bowl. Refrigerate until needed.</li>
        <li>Arrange baguette pieces on the prepared baking sheet and drizzle olive oil on top. Toss and arrange bread into a single layer.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Turn bread and cook until browned, about 8 minutes more. Transfer to a bowl.</li>
        <li>Place the tempeh on the baking sheet; reserve the liquid. Bake for 10 minutes, basting with some of the reserved marinade halfway through. Flip tempeh; bake, basting again, for 10 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Cut tempeh into cubes. Arrange the bread, tempeh, jalapeno slices, pickled daikon, carrot, cucumber, and cilantro into serving bowls. Top with sriracha mayo.</li>
    </ol>
